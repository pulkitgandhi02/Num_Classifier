**Number Checker** is a simple and interactive web tool that lets users check if a given number is:

* 🧮 **Odd or Even**
* 🔍 **Prime or Not Prime**
* 🧠 And handles special cases like **2**, the only even prime

It includes:

* Clean and responsive UI
* Instant feedback with alerts
* Input validation for invalid entries like 0, negatives, or non-numeric values

Whether you're learning number theory, coding basics, or just curious — this tool gives quick and clear results!

Would you like an extended version with tech stack and deployment instructions as well? I can also create a ready-to-use `README.md` file for your GitHub repo if you're planning to publish it.
